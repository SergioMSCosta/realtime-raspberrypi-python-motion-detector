# Realtime RaspberyPi Motion Detector #
This is the code for my blog post entitled "[RaspberryPi motion detector with remote alert using Realtime and Python](http://sergiocosta.me/post/49453141093/raspberrypi-motion-detector-realtime-python)".

This repository is comprised of the Python code necessary to run it on your RaspberryPi. Please note that you will need to have some modules installed on your RPi, namely [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome), and a webcam. Of course, a [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) is useful, although I'm pretty sure you can do without one and just use your regular Linux computer.

I hope you enjoy the post and the example. If you have any questions, doubts, corrections or ideas, please feel free to drop by my blog and contact me.
